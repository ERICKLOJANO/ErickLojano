		<h2>What data structure was used? and why?</h2>
		<p1> The data structure that was used was Hashmap, because this all the words from the songs to be stored as "keys". Not only that but Hashmaps are also useful because you can set a "value" to a certain "key". In this case, everytiime a word was repeated, the value of the "key" was increased by one.</p1>
		
		<h3>The Visualization Technique Used</h3>
		<p2> The particular data visualization technique I used was a word cloud, and I decided to use it because it was a creative way to show all the words that were used in the song. But in this technique we are able to see the most common words, the words with a bigger font size have been repeated more often than those with a smaller font.</p2>
		
		<h4>Is there anything you’d want to improve if you had more time to work on the project? How might you scale the project?</h4>
		<p3>If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely improve my webpage by adding more interactive features, because at the moment its basic and could use some cool features that would make the user who’s viewing my webpage more intrigued. A way I would scale the project would be by having a colleague, this way their can be two “teams” and each person can focus on a specific part of the project.</p3>

		<h5>Why did you choose this particular song?<br>Was the song ever a billboard top hit? When?</h5>
		<p4> I chose this song because at the time the project was assigned(assignment 3 & 4) it was chilly outside, and it was literally feeling like “sweater weather.” But, also because growing up it was one of my favorite songs, and everyone thinks its a classic!<br>The song was never a Billboard top hit, but it peaked at #14 on December 28, 2013.

		<h6>What were the top words found? Was it a surprise?</h6>
		<p5>Some of the top words found were “woah, cold, sweater,holes, hands, love,” and this comes with no surprise because these words all come from the pre-chorus & chorus. The chorus is the catchiest part of the song, and it repeats about 3 times.</p5>
